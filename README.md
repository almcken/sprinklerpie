# Sprinkler Pie

Welcome. The Sprinkler Pie is a Raspberry Pi controlled, Google sheets integrated, Rain Bird modular, lawn watering machine.

### Getting Started
Running `python chanTrue.py 2` will activate channel 2 on your Raspberry Pi. 

The mapping from GPIO pins to relay module:
- channel 2 = Relay switch 1
- channel 3 = Relay switch 2
- channel 4 = Relay switch 3
- channel 27 = Relay switch 4

This project relies on a Google speadsheet located here:
